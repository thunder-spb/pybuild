# after untarring on another machine, we have a program call imports.py which imports 
# every library as a quick check that it works. For a more positive check, run it like this
strace -e trace=stat,fstat,open python imports.py >strace.txt 2>&1 
grep -v ' = -1' strace.txt |grep 'open(' >opens.txt
sed <opens.txt 's/^open("//;s/".*//' |sort -u |grep -v 'dynload' |grep '\.so' |  while read ln; do readlink -m $ln; done >straced.txt
ls -1d /data1/packages/python272/lib/* | while read ln; do readlink -m $ln; done |sort -u >lib.txt
# then examine the strace output to see how many places it searches before finding it.
# lib.txt is there so that you can diff it with straced.txt
# a successful library load will be a call to open that doesn't end with ' = -1'
# If it takes too many tries to find a particular library, then another
# symbolic link may be a good idea
